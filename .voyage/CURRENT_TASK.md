# CURRENT_TASK

## Previous task

**Task ID:** `NCC-DALLE-17-GENERATION-2026-07-09`

**Final status:** `CLOSED_REDESIGNED`

**Closure reason:** The original blind 17-image generation list was found to duplicate existing approved visual coverage. It was replaced by a coverage-based workflow.

### Completed results from the redesigned work

- OLGA pool/wellness public-safe v1 deployed and pushed in commit `6229e0d`.
- OLGA swimsuit pool/wellness v2/v3 retained in `LOCAL_STORAGE` by human decision B.
- OLGA DALL-E evening embankment ALT deployed and pushed in commit `8e07904`.
- `01_evening_embankment` remains MAIN.
- `08_dalle_evening_embankment` is ALT / DALL-E backend variant.
- Empty duplicate `09_yoga_studio` folder was removed.

### Superseded rule

Do not continue the original 17-image count mechanically.

### Active workflow rule

Before every future generation:

1. Audit existing visual coverage.
2. Extract exact character anchors from repo canon files.
3. Select explicit reference images.
4. Prepare `prompt_id`, `reference_paths`, `output_path`, and storage tier.
5. Generate only after the scene is confirmed missing.
6. Record APPROVED / REJECTED / DRAFT result.
